# WS1617_Tensor_Networks

The code is fully contained in one .py file named tensortestsV< version number >.py.

The functions typically have an extensive description of what they do (for some of the older functions (analysis1 to analysis11)
this may not be the case, but these were used to test hypotheses early into the development of the code and are not essential 
for the topcis actually covered in the Bachelor thesis.

Additional improvements or further analyses may be implemented after the submission of the Bachelor thesis, but will have a version
number higher than zero to preserve that state of the code at the time point of submission.
